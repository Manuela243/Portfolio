# Portfolio
- One way is to let everyone know you are in a world of developing, and that is portfolio. That is why I choose to make my own. For now, it might not be the one to stand from the crowd, but it is functional, it works and it shows that I am serious about learning.
- While making it, I noticed how easily you can get lost of you do not track well your changes, so it taught me how to be extra careful when writing messages to commit.
- I wanted to make it fun and playful, wanted to use colors that best suit me.
- For now, I do not, yet, still have any kind of real projects to show off with, but I do believe in no time I will be able to add then to my portfolio.

## My process

### Built with

 **HTML** <br>
 **CSS** <br>
 **Javascript**

### What I learned

1. To be careful while using div and class, and how to put everything in section and make it make sense
2. That comments inside the code can be used to navigate through the code, and that they have a higher use than just being comment, they can tell others what is it in that section (used both in HTML, CSS and Javascript).
3. Got introduced on how to use Responsive Web Design.
4. Learned how to use root: (for easier and faster coding you use it to set default colors and more that you will later use with var())
5. Used *raw.githack.com* to get an url for my live page.
