            <p>My name is Manuela. I am 25 years old and I come from Koprivnica, currently situated in Varaždin.
                I am a <b>self-taught</b> frontend developer. I came to Varaždin with one goal, to fulfill my dream of becoming a 
                developer, after finding out about many oportunities the city has to offer.

                <h3>I am a <span>Frontend Developer</span></h3>
                <p>I still remember the time in primary school when we started working with HTML. It seemed interesting as to
                    how writing some specific words and inbetween adding your own, you get a complete website that might be
                    used one day by literary everyone in the whole world!<br>
                    Life usually takes you on different paths than the one you want, so last year I chose to make a difference. 
                    I want to change my life. I found out my passion for development has grown stronger than ever. <br>
                    I will have masters in law, but coding is something I love with all my heart.<br>
                    I started to self-teach HTML, CSS and Javascript, after a long search over the internet for a good roadmap to follow.
                    I learned from FreeCodeCamp, The Odins Project, The Geeks and many more sites, and of course, YouTube came in handy.<br>
                    Whenever I have free time after work, I try to code and learn more and more. I can not wait to see
                    what other programming languages I will be able to learn and use with ease. <br>
                    But, it is not easy to do it all alone, that is why I am looking for an opportunitey to find a place where I can grow with others, 
                    get guidance that I need, and that can be a bootcamp or a full-time job. I want to show that I am ready and not afraid to 
                    work hard everyday in order to achive what I dream of. I want to be able to not only code in my free time, but to code alongside people that share
                    the same passion as I do.

            <p class="about-p">Since high school, I loved working with HTML, and I considered computers
                to be my best friends. But, life took me on another path. I choose not to let
                it and I found passion in programming again. <br> This last year I have started
                to study and I am <strong>self taught</strong>. With all the information online I am hoping
                to become a part of the IT world. That is one of the reasons I came to Varaždin. <br>
                I am actively looking for a place to start my journey, to actively learn and work. To 
                become one of the team. Place where it is okay to be junior and a place that will
                help me become better.
